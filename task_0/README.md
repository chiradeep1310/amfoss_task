Installing Ubuntu!
Installed Ubuntu in laptop. I downloaded Ubuntu software from its official website. I've done installing Ubuntu after watching a tutorial in YouTube. But still I failed in my first attempt. When I tried installing, I was not able figure out what exactly the problem was and ended up getting an error message which said installation failed. After uninstalling previous setup, I gave a second attempt, this time I gave a partition after shrinking 100gb volume of ssd for Ubuntu . and formatted the pendrive containing Ubuntu file and tried installing from boot manager. After installing Ubuntu I installed Wi-Fi drivers as I was not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Finally, all the necessities were met and I installed Ubuntu on my laptop .
