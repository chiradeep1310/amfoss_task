As I was initially unable to use rust for this question(not so familiar with the syntax), I uploaded the solution to this problem in Python3.
 After learning syntax of rust(related to Regex), first step was to create a variable "line" which is mutable.
After that, take the input(e-mail address) and assign it to the variable "line".
Then define all the patter's limits that regex has to consider.
Then check whether entered email is matching with any of the pattererns formed by regex.
If true, the email address enterd by the user is valid.
