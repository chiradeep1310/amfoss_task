# AMFOSS TASKS
## This repository is there to showcase my amfoss talks.
###SO FAR, I HAVE COMPLEATED 9 tasks

Task 0 :
Installing Ubuntu!

Installed Ubuntu in laptop. I downloaded Ubuntu software from its official website. I've done installing Ubuntu after watching a tutorial in YouTube. But still I failed in my first attempt. When I tried installing, I was not able figure out what exactly the problem was and ended up getting an error message which said installation failed. After uninstalling previous setup, I gave a second attempt, this time I gave a partition after shrinking 100gb volume of ssd for Ubuntu . and formatted the pendrive containing Ubuntu file and tried installing from boot manager. Finally, all the necessities were met and I installed Ubuntu on my laptop .

Task 1 :
For compleating this task, i followed the instructions given in the readme file of github link given. After getting the final flag, I took ascreen shot and uploaded it.

Task 2 :
For solving these questions, I opted python(3). Rest of the part was just problem solving.

Task 7 :
As I was initially unable to use rust for this question(not so familiar with the syntax), I uploaded the solution to this problem in Python3. After learning syntax of rust(related to Regex), first step was to create a variable "line" which is mutable. After that, take the input(e-mail address) and assign it to the variable "line". Then define all the patter's limits that regex has to consider. Then check whether entered email is matching with any of the pattererns formed by regex. If true, the email address enterd by the user is valid.

Task 8 :
For performing this task, I first instaleed PIL, which means python image library. Then I installed pillow. Then I installed pytesseract. After these installations, I produced a python code which could perform the given task REFERENCE:https://youtu.be/kxHp5ng6Rgw

Task 9 :
The link of personal website created is given below. I forked the github/personal-website and installed Jekyll gem in the personal website folder. Then I customized the website by editing the config.yml file and hosted the website using git pages. https://chiradeep1310.github.io/ Refernce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc&t=734s

Task 12 :
For decoding and obtaining the flag, the order must be dehexing, then de-xoring( or simply xor it again) and then shifting.

In dehexing, we will add two consecutive charecters as one charachter and then, these charachters are dehexed and stored into bytearray. I converted this bytearray into string as i am more comfortable with string.

For de-xoring, de-xoring is the same as the xor operation. So we apply the same xor opperation to the string's each charechter now and store it into a list.

After de-xoring, all the charechter's ascii values are shifted according to the key given.

Finally, after converting the following list to string, Reversing is done!:)

Task 13 :
This task is similar to task 2 because this is also problem solving
